Capstone Project 2

This program allows the admin to register new users and assign tasks to registered users.
Both the registered users and tasks are later written into a .txt file for preservation.
Once the program is running the code will run and output contents of code based on user input.
A list of user choices inside the code:  
        r - Registering a user
        a - Adding a task
        va - View all tasks
        vm - view my task
        ds - view stats
        e - Exit

Simply download the python file and the attached user and task .txt files to run the program.
